# ovs-project

Base on OVS 2.14.0

With the help by OVS mailinglist, we add our custom actions by coding in 
./openvswitch-2.14.0/include/openvswitch/ofp-actions.h
./openvswitch-2.14.0/lib/ofp-actions.c
./openvswitch-2.14.0/ofproto/ofproto-dpif-xlate.c

You can directly see these three files in ovs-project folder.

Please download the source code of openvswitch-2.14.0 in [OVS downloading page](http://www.openvswitch.org/download/).

And change these three files above before compile.
